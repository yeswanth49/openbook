# APM Implementation Plan Formatting Guide

## 1. Purpose

This guide provides the definitive formatting standard and best practices for constructing the `Implementation_Plan.md` file within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework. As the Manager Agent, creating this document is a core responsibility outlined in your initiation protocol (Phase B: Strategic Planning). Following your presentation of a high-level plan summary and Memory Bank proposal to the User (and their implicit approval by not immediately requesting changes to that summary/proposal), you will use this guide to generate the **full content** of the `Implementation_Plan.md` file. This document translates the project's strategic objectives into a detailed, actionable blueprint for all agents.

Adherence to this standard ensures clarity, consistency, effective task tracking, and robust project management.

## 2. Core Principles

- **Clarity:** The plan must be easily understandable by the User, the Manager Agent (current and future), and all Implementation/Specialized Agents.
- **Detail:** Tasks and sub-tasks must be sufficiently granular to be directly actionable by Implementation Agents.
- **Structure:** A logical, hierarchical organization facilitates navigation, progress tracking, and automated parsing (if applicable).
- **Consistency:** Uniform formatting enhances readability and simplifies integration with other APM artifacts (e.g., Memory Bank logs, Task Assignment Prompts).
- **Traceability:** Clearly link tasks back to project goals and requirements.
- **Adaptability:** Recognize that this plan may evolve; structure it to accommodate potential future modifications or additions agreed upon with the User, while maintaining formatting consistency.

## 2.5 Prerequisite: User Approval of Plan Structure

**CRITICAL:** Before applying the detailed formatting rules below, you **must** have presented the proposed _structure_ of the implementation plan (including phases, major tasks, and conceptual agent assignments) to the User and received their explicit approval. This guide details how to format that _approved_ structure, not how to initially devise it.

## 3. Formatting Standard (Markdown)

Utilize standard Markdown syntax. The following structure is mandated:

### 3.1. Overall Structure

- The document must start with a Level 1 Heading (`# Implementation Plan`).
- A brief (1-2 sentence) introductory summary of the overall project goal is required.

### 3.2. Phased Structure (For Large/Complex Projects)

- If the project warrants division into phases (as determined during discovery and approved by the User), use Level 2 Headings (`##`) for each phase.
- Include the phase number and a descriptive title (e.g., `## Phase 1: Backend Setup`).
- **Recommended:** Assign a conceptual "Agent Group" to the phase for high-level planning (e.g., `Agent Group Alpha`). This assignment is illustrative and aids planning.
    - **Format Example:** `## Phase 1: Core Backend Setup - Agent Group Alpha (Agent A, Agent B)`

### 3.3. Task Definition

- Use Level 3 Headings (`###`) for each major task within a phase (or directly under the main heading if not phased).
- Include a task identifier (e.g., `Task A`, `Task B`, `Task 1.1`) and a concise, descriptive title.
    - Use a consistent identifier scheme distinct from Implementation Agent IDs.
- **CRITICAL: Explicit Agent Assignment per Task:**
    - For EVERY task, you _MUST_ explicitly assign one or more Implementation Agents responsible for its execution. This is non-negotiable for a functional multi-agent workflow.
    - **Consider Task Distribution:** Reflect on the project's needs. Does the task require a specific skill (e.g., frontend, data analysis, testing)? Could different tasks be handled by different specialized agents for efficiency or to parallelize work? Avoid defaulting all tasks to a single generic agent if the project benefits from specialization or distribution. Define clear, distinct agent identifiers (e.g., `Agent_Frontend_Dev`, `Agent_Data_Processor`, `Agent_QA`).
    - The assigned agent identifier(s) become integral to task tracking and prompt generation.
    - **Format (Single Agent):** `### Task A - Agent_XYZ: [Descriptive Task Title]` (e.g., `### Task 1.1 - Agent_Setup_Specialist: Environment Configuration`)
    - **Format (Multiple Cooperating Agents on the Same Task):** `### Task B (Complex) - Agent_ABC & Agent_DEF: [Descriptive Task Title]`
- Follow the heading with a brief (1-2 sentence) description stating the task's objective.

### 3.4. Sub-Task Decomposition

- Use Markdown ordered lists (`1.`, `2.`, `3.`) for logical sub-components or stages within each main task.
- **Detailed Action Steps with Critical Guidance:** Within each numbered sub-component, use nested bullet points (`-` or `*`) to list the specific, fine-grained actions.
    - **Crucial Detail for Consistency:** For these nested action steps, if a specific method, library, algorithm, parameter, or approach is critical for the task's success or for consistency with subsequent tasks, include a _brief guiding note_. This is not meant to be a full instruction set (that belongs in the task assignment prompt) but rather a key constraint or pointer.
    - **Example of Guiding Note:**
        - `- Implement data tokenization for user reviews.`
            - `Guidance: Use DistilBERT tokenizer ('distilbert-base-uncased') to align with the planned sentiment model.`
        - `- Store processed data.`
            - `Guidance: Output to a Parquet file named 'processed_reviews.parquet'.`
    - These guiding notes ensure that subsequent agents don't have to guess critical choices made earlier or go down an incompatible path.
    - The detailed breakdown and these guiding notes are crucial as they directly inform the content of the `Task Assignment Prompts` (see `03_Task_Assignment_Prompts_Guide.md`).
- Each nested bullet point (and its optional guiding note) should represent a distinct, actionable step or check for the Implementation Agent.
- **Appropriate Detail and Context:** Ensure the nested action steps (and their guiding notes) reflect specifics derived from the project discovery, requirements, and approved plan. Incorporate necessary high-level details like critical error handling specifics to be considered, key validation rules, or integration points.
- For tasks with multiple assigned agents, clearly mark which agent is responsible for each **numbered sub-component** using parentheses.
- **Format Examples:**
    - **Single Agent Task:**
        ```markdown
        1.  Design database schema for User entity.
            - Define fields: user_id (PK), username (unique), email (unique), password_hash, created_at.
            - Specify data types and constraints.
        2.  Create database migrations.
            - Generate migration file using the ORM tool.
            - Write migration script to create the User table.
            - Write rollback script.
        ```
    - **Multi-Agent Task:**
        ```markdown
        1.  (Agent A) Research and evaluate potential API providers.
            - Identify 3-5 potential geolocation API services.
            - Document API features, pricing, and rate limits for each.
            - Provide a recommendation based on project requirements.
        2.  (Agent B) Implement client library for the selected API.
            - Create API client module.
            - Implement functions for primary API endpoints needed.
            * Include necessary error handling for network timeouts, API errors (e.g., 4xx, 5xx), and invalid responses.
        3.  (Agent C) Write API integration tests.
            - Set up testing environment with mock API or sandbox keys.
            - Write tests covering primary success paths (e.g., valid address lookup).
            - Write tests for common failure modes (e.g., invalid API key, address not found, rate limiting).
        ```
- Strive for a balance where numbered sub-components represent logical stages, and nested bullets provide the necessary implementation detail.

## 5. Final Considerations

- **Consistency is Key:** Ensure uniform application of headings, lists, agent assignments, and formatting throughout the document.
- **Generate After High-Level Summary:** Generate this file's full content based on the high-level plan structure and Memory Bank concept you have already summarized to the User. The User will be invited to review and suggest modifications to _this generated file_ subsequently.
- **Clarity and Detail:** While the initial summary to the User is high-level, _this file_ must contain sufficient detail for Implementation Agents to understand their tasks, scope, and objectives clearly.
- **Memory Bank Structure Record:** Crucially, after the Memory Bank system (single-file or multi-file directory) has been determined and proposed by you (the Manager Agent) by following `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md`, and subsequently agreed upon with the User, you **must** include a dedicated subsection within this `Implementation_Plan.md` (e.g., under "General Project Notes" or as a distinct section if complex). This subsection must explicitly state the agreed-upon Memory Bank structure (e.g., "Memory Bank System: Single file `Memory_Bank.md`" or "Memory Bank System: Directory `/Memory/` with log files per phase, such as `Memory/Phase1_Design_Log.md`, as detailed in `Memory/README.md`."). This ensures all agents are aware of the established logging structure and where to find or create log entries.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Be prepared to update this document based on User feedback or as the project evolves (following appropriate change management discussions).

By following this guide, you will produce `Implementation_Plan.md` files that are comprehensive, clear, and serve as a reliable foundation for project execution.

## 6. Post-Plan Generation: Next Steps & Ongoing Management

Once the `Implementation_Plan.md` is created and approved:

- **Task Assignment Prompt Generation:** For each task assigned to an Implementation Agent, you will assist the User in crafting a precise prompt. Refer to the `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/03_Task_Assignment_Prompts_Guide.md` (if available) for detailed instructions on structuring these prompts effectively. If the guide is unavailable, generate clear, actionable prompts based on the task and sub-task details in this plan.
- **Review and Feedback Cycle:** As Implementation Agents complete tasks and log their work to the Memory Bank, you are responsible for reviewing their outputs. Refer to the `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/04_Review_And_Feedback_Guide.md` (if available) for guidance on conducting reviews and providing constructive feedback. If unavailable, perform reviews based on the task objectives and general best practices.
- **Handover Protocol Reference (Crucial):** To ensure project continuity and awareness of context management procedures, you **must include** a dedicated section at the _end_ of the generated `Implementation_Plan.md` file itself. This section should briefly explain the purpose of the Handover Protocol and provide an explicit reference to its detailed guide.

    - **Example text to include in `Implementation_Plan.md`:**

        ```markdown
        ---

        ## Note on Handover Protocol

        For long-running projects or situations requiring context transfer (e.g., exceeding LLM context limits, changing specialized agents), the APM Handover Protocol should be initiated. This ensures smooth transitions and preserves project knowledge. Detailed procedures are outlined in the framework guide:

        `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/05_Handover_Protocol_Guide.md`

        The current Manager Agent or the User should initiate this protocol as needed.
        ```

Proceed with generating the `Implementation_Plan.md` content, meticulously applying these formatting standards and including the Handover Protocol reference section.
