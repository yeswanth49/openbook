# APM Task Assignment Prompt Crafting Guide

## 1. Purpose

This guide provides instructions and best practices for you, the Manager Agent, to craft effective prompts for assigning tasks to Implementation Agents within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework. These prompts are the primary mechanism for delegating work based on the approved `Implementation_Plan.md`.

## 2. Core Principles

- **Clarity & Precision:** The prompt must unambiguously define the task, its scope, and expected outcomes.
- **Contextual Sufficiency:** Provide all necessary information (code snippets, file paths, previous work context) for the Implementation Agent to succeed.
- **Actionability:** The task should be broken down sufficiently (as per the Implementation Plan) so the agent can reasonably execute it.
- **Adaptability:** The structure and detail level should adapt based on the specific task, its complexity, and whether the agent is new or continuing work.
- **Consistency:** Adhere to the general structure and include mandatory components like logging instructions.

## 3. Recommended Prompt Structure (Adaptable)

Below is a recommended structure. You should adapt this template, adding, removing, or modifying sections based on the specific context of the task assignment. Not all sections are required for every prompt.

# APM Task Assignment: [Brief Task Title]

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context (Required for First Task to a New Agent)

- **Introduction:** "You are activated as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the [Project Name/Goal] project."
- **Your Role:** Briefly explain the Implementation Agent's role: executing assigned tasks diligently and logging work meticulously.
- **Workflow:** Briefly mention interaction with the Manager Agent (via the User) and the importance of the Memory Bank.
- **Note:** _If a dedicated `Agent_Onboarding_Context.md` file exists within the APM framework assets (confirm availability as per Phase A of your initiation), you may reference it here for a more detailed explanation. Otherwise, provide this summary._

## 2. Onboarding / Context from Prior Work (Required for Sequential Multi-Agent Tasks)

- **Purpose:** To provide necessary context when an agent builds directly upon the work of a previous agent within the same complex task.
- **Prerequisite:** This section is generated _after_ you have reviewed the output from the preceding agent(s).
- **Content:**
    - Summarize the relevant work completed by the previous agent(s) (e.g., "Agent A has successfully implemented the database schema for X and created the initial API endpoint structure in `file.py`.").
    - Include key findings from your review (e.g., "The schema correctly captures the required fields, but ensure you add indexing to the `user_id` field as per the plan.").
    - Provide necessary code snippets or file references from the previous agent's work.
    - Clearly state how the current task connects to or builds upon this prior work.

## 3. Task Assignment

- **Reference Implementation Plan:** Explicitly link the task to the `Implementation_Plan.md`. Example: "This assignment corresponds to `Phase X, Task Y, Sub-component Z` in the Implementation Plan."
- **Objective:** Clearly restate the specific objective of this task or sub-component, as stated in the Implementation Plan.
- **Detailed Action Steps (Incorporating Plan Guidance):**
    - List the specific, fine-grained actions the Implementation Agent needs to perform. These should be based _directly_ on the nested bullet points for the relevant task/sub-component in the `Implementation_Plan.md`.
    - **Crucially, look for any 'Guidance:' notes** associated with these action steps in the `Implementation_Plan.md`. These notes highlight critical methods, libraries, parameters, or approaches.
    - **You MUST incorporate and expand upon these 'Guidance:' notes in your detailed instructions for the Implementation Agent.** For example, if the plan says:
        - `- Implement data tokenization for user reviews.`
            - `Guidance: Use DistilBERT tokenizer ('distilbert-base-uncased').`
    - Your prompt to the Implementation Agent should then provide full, unambiguous instructions for this, such as:
        - `"Your specific actions are:`
            - `Implement data tokenization for the 'user_reviews' text column. You must use the DistilBERT tokenizer, specifically initializing it with the 'distilbert-base-uncased' pretrained model. Ensure the output includes 'input_ids' and 'attention_mask'."`
    - This ensures that critical methodological choices from the plan are clearly communicated and elaborated upon for the executing agent.
- **Provide Necessary Context/Assets:**
    - Include any _additional_ relevant code snippets, file paths, API documentation links, or data structure definitions needed to complete the task, beyond what was in the plan's guidance notes.
    - Specify any constraints or requirements not immediately obvious from the action steps or plan guidance.

## 4. Expected Output & Deliverables

- **Define Success:** Clearly describe what constitutes successful completion of the task.
- **Specify Deliverables:** List the expected outputs (e.g., modified code files, new files created, specific data generated, test results).
- **Format (If applicable):** Specify any required format for the output.

## 5. Memory Bank Logging Instructions (Mandatory)

- **Instruction:** "Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's `Memory_Bank.md` file."
- **Format Adherence:** "Adhere strictly to the established logging format. Ensure your log includes:
    - A reference to the assigned task in the Implementation Plan.
    - A clear description of the actions taken.
    - Any code snippets generated or modified.
    - Any key decisions made or challenges encountered.
    - Confirmation of successful execution (e.g., tests passing, output generated)."
- **Note:** _If a dedicated `Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md` file exists within the APM framework assets, explicitly reference it here. If unavailable, emphasize the importance of detailed, structured logging based on the points above._

## 6. Clarification Instruction

- **Instruction:** "If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding."
```

## 4. Best Practices & Adaptability

- **Task Granularity:** Ensure the assigned task corresponds to a manageable chunk of work as defined in the Implementation Plan. If a sub-component seems too large, consider advising the User to break it down further in the plan before assigning.
- **Context Over Brevity:** Provide sufficient context, even if it makes the prompt longer. Missing context is a primary cause of agent errors.
- **Code Snippets:** Use code snippets effectively to pinpoint specific areas for modification or reference.
- **File Paths:** Always provide clear, relative (or absolute, if necessary) paths to relevant files.
- **Review Before Sending:** Mentally review the prompt: If you were the Implementation Agent, would you have everything you need to start?
- **Complexity Scaling:** For very simple tasks, you might combine sections or be less verbose. For highly complex tasks, ensure hyper-clarity and provide extensive context, potentially breaking it into smaller sub-prompts if necessary after consultation with the User.

### Ensuring Adherence to Memory and Logging Standards

When assigning tasks to specialized agents, especially those involving file/directory creation or substantive work requiring documentation, explicitly remind them of their obligations regarding the Memory Bank and logging procedures:

- **Memory Bank Structure:** "Ensure all Memory Bank directory and file creations strictly adhere to the naming conventions and structural guidelines detailed in the `02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md`. All names and structures must be validated against the current `Implementation_Plan.md` **before** creation. If there is any ambiguity, consult back with the Manager Agent."
- **Log Conciseness and Quality:** "All log entries must conform to the `Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`. Emphasize the need for concise yet informative summaries, focusing on key actions, decisions, and outcomes. Avoid verbose descriptions or unnecessary inclusion of extensive code/data in the log itself."

Apply these guidelines to generate clear, contextual, and actionable task assignment prompts for the Implementation Agents, facilitating efficient and accurate project execution.
